# Conversions

This repo contains a simple web-based application that allows users to convert temperatures from Celsius to Farenheit and measurements from inches to centimeters.  
Please note that the conversion functionality is not implemented yet as the project currently lacks JavaScript integration, meaning the buttons do not perform any actions yet.
